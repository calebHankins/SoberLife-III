# SoberLife - Stress Management Game Design Document

## Game Overview

**SoberLife** is a web-based stress management game that combines blackjack mechanics with everyday task completion. Players navigate stressful real-world scenarios (like DMV visits) while managing their stress levels through strategic gameplay and zen activities.

## Core Concept

The game uses familiar blackjack rules as a metaphor for handling life's challenges - getting as close to success (21) as possible without "busting" (losing control). Each successful hand represents successfully managing a step in a stressful task.

## Game Mechanics

### Primary Systems

#### 1. Blackjack Gameplay

- **Traditional Rules**: Standard blackjack against the house
- **Win Condition**: Get closer to 21 than house without going over
- **Card Values**: Aces (1/11), Face cards (10), Numbers (face value)
- **House Rules**: Dealer hits on 16, stands on 17

#### 2. Stress Management System

- **Stress Meter**: Visual bar showing current stress level (0-100%)
- **Stress Sources**:
  - Losing blackjack hands (+15% stress)
  - Busting (+30% stress)
  - Ties (+5% stress)
- **Stress Relief**:
  - Winning hands (-5% stress)
  - Zen activities (variable reduction)
- **Game Over**: Reaching 100% stress triggers failure

#### 3. Zen Points Economy

- **Currency System**: Earned through successful gameplay
- **Earning**: Win blackjack hands (+15 points), house busts (+15 points), ties (+5 points)
- **Spending**: Purchase stress relief activities
- **No Lose Condition**: 0 zen points doesn't end game, just limits options

#### 4. Zen Activities (Stress Relief)

- **Deep Breath**: 10 zen points → -10% stress
- **Quick Stretch**: 25 zen points → -20% stress  
- **Mini Meditation**: 50 zen points → -35% stress
- **Strategic Timing**: Can be used between rounds for stress management

### Task Structure

#### Multi-Step Scenarios
