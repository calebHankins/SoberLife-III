### Development Workflow

1. Make changes to the appropriate files (HTML, CSS, or JavaScript modules)
2. Refresh your browser to see changes
3. Run tests in `tests/` directory to verify functionality
4. No build process required - files are served directly

### Serving with a Local Server (Optional)

For testing ES6 modules, you may want to serve the files through a local server:

```bash
# Node.js
npx serve . -p 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## 💎 Zen Points System

### Overview
Zen points serve as the game's primary currency, earned through gameplay and spent on stress relief activities and permanent deck upgrades.

### Earning Zen Points
- **Task Start Bonus**: +100 zen points when beginning any task
- **Round Wins**: +15 zen points for winning blackjack rounds
- **House Bust**: +15 zen points when the house busts
- **Task Completion**: +1000-2000 zen points based on performance (lower stress = higher bonus)

### Spending Zen Points
- **Stress Relief Activities**: Deep breathing (10), stretching (25), meditation (50)
- **Deck Upgrades**: Add Aces (75, 125, 175, 225... progressive pricing)
- **Joker Cards**: Add Wild Jokers (75, 125, 175... progressive pricing)

### Persistence Architecture
The zen points system uses a centralized manager (`ZenPointsManager`) that:
- Maintains the authoritative balance across all game modes
- Automatically syncs with campaign state for persistence
- Handles all transactions with proper logging and validation
- Ensures UI consistency across all screens

## 🔧 Recent Updates

### Zen Points Persistence Fix (Critical)
- **Root Issue**: Task completion bonuses weren't persisting when returning to campaign overview
- **Cause**: Timing issue where completion bonus was awarded after campaign state was saved
- **Solution**: Reordered task completion flow to award bonus before saving state
- **UI Sync Fix**: Added `updateDisplay()` calls to campaign navigation functions
- **Testing**: Comprehensive end-to-end testing of task completion → shop purchase → campaign return flow

### Campaign System Implementation

- **Rogue-like progression**: Complete tasks to unlock new challenges
- **Deck upgrades**: Spend zen points to add Aces between tasks
- **Task-specific content**: Each scenario has unique actions and success messages
- **Progress persistence**: Campaign state saves automatically

### Bug Fixes

- **Step counter reset**: Tasks now properly start at step 1 instead of continuing from previous task
- **Task-specific success screens**: Completion messages now match the completed task (DMV vs Job Interview)
- **Campaign reset functionality**: Reset and New Campaign buttons properly clear all state
- **Error recovery**: Robust state validation and repair mechanisms
