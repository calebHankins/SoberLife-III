#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game loads on a mobile device THEN the entire game interface SHALL fit within the viewport height without requiring vertical scrolling
2. WHEN the user rotates their device THEN the game SHALL adapt to the new orientation while maintaining proper layout
3. WHEN all game elements are displayed THEN they SHALL remain visible and accessible without scrolling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want game elements to be appropriately sized for touch interaction, so that I can easily tap buttons and interact with the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text is displayed on mobile THEN it SHALL maintain appropriate font sizes for readability
2. WHEN the game container is resized for mobile THEN padding and margins SHALL be optimized for smaller screens
3. WHEN survey questions are displayed THEN they SHALL remain easily readable and selectable on mobile devices

### Requirement 5
