# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds immersive, step-appropriate initial flavor text that appears before the user takes their first hit in each task step. The flavor text will set the scene and provide roleplay context to help players feel more engaged with the specific scenario they're navigating (DMV visit, job interview, etc.). This enhances the educational and emotional connection to stress management by making each step feel like a real-world situation.

2. WHEN the flavor text is displayed THEN the system SHALL hide or disable the hit/stand buttons until the player acknowledges the text
