# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring SoberLife III from its current single-file architecture (index.html containing all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) into a well-organized multi-file structure. The goal is to improve maintainability, code organization, and development workflow while preserving all existing functionality and ensuring the game continues to work seamlessly via GitHub Pages deployment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase organized into separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that I can maintain and modify different aspects of the game more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL have separate files for HTML structure, CSS styles, and JavaScript logic
2. WHEN viewing the project structure THEN the system SHALL organize files in a logical directory structure that separates concerns
3. WHEN making changes to styling THEN developers SHALL be able to modify CSS files without touching HTML or JavaScript
4. WHEN making changes to game logic THEN developers SHALL be able to modify JavaScript files without touching HTML or CSS

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to function identically after the refactoring, so that my gameplay experience remains unchanged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the game via GitHub Pages THEN the system SHALL load and function exactly as before the refactoring
2. WHEN playing the game THEN all existing features SHALL work without any functional changes
3. WHEN the game loads THEN the visual appearance SHALL be identical to the current single-file version
4. WHEN interacting with game elements THEN all animations, transitions, and user interactions SHALL behave as before

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a deployment system, I want the refactored files to work seamlessly with GitHub Pages, so that the automated deployment continues to function without configuration changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GitHub Actions workflow runs THEN the system SHALL successfully deploy the multi-file structure to GitHub Pages
2. WHEN users visit the GitHub Pages URL THEN the system SHALL serve the game without any loading errors
3. WHEN the index.html file is requested THEN the system SHALL properly load all referenced CSS and JavaScript files
4. WHEN deployed THEN the system SHALL maintain the same URL structure and accessibility as the current version

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear separation between different types of code, so that I can quickly locate and modify specific functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the file structure THEN the system SHALL have dedicated directories for styles, scripts, and assets
2. WHEN looking for game logic THEN developers SHALL find JavaScript files organized by functionality (game state, card logic, UI updates, etc.)
3. WHEN looking for styling THEN developers SHALL find CSS files organized by component or feature area
4. WHEN examining the HTML THEN it SHALL contain only structural markup with external references to styles and scripts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want updated documentation that reflects the new file structure, so that new contributors can understand the project organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the README.md SHALL be updated to reflect the new file structure
2. WHEN examining project documentation THEN the model_spec.md SHALL be updated with the new architecture details
3. WHEN reviewing steering files THEN the structure.md and tech.md files SHALL be updated to match the new organization
4. WHEN new developers join THEN they SHALL have clear documentation about where to find different types of code

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the refactored code to maintain the same development workflow simplicity, so that local testing remains straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing locally THEN developers SHALL still be able to open index.html directly in a browser for testing
2. WHEN making changes THEN the development workflow SHALL remain as simple as editing files and refreshing the browser
3. WHEN testing locally THEN all file references SHALL work correctly when served from the local file system
4. WHEN using a local server THEN all assets SHALL load properly without requiring a build process
