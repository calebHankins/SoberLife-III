# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on enhancing the role-play immersion in SoberLife III by improving the messaging system for turn actions and game outcomes. The goal is to make the DMV scenario feel more authentic by reducing blackjack terminology and strengthening the contextual, stress-management narrative. Additionally, we need to implement progressive flavor text for repeated "Hit" actions to provide variety and maintain engagement.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player navigating the DMV scenario, I want the game messages to feel like authentic DMV experiences rather than blackjack terminology, so that I stay immersed in the stress management learning experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player loses a round THEN the system SHALL display DMV-themed failure messages instead of "House wins"
2. WHEN the player's score exceeds 21 THEN the system SHALL display stress-related messages instead of "Busted"
3. WHEN the player wins a round THEN the system SHALL display DMV success messages that relate to handling bureaucratic pressure
4. WHEN the player ties THEN the system SHALL display neutral DMV-themed messages about patience and persistence
5. WHEN the house exceeds 21 THEN the system SHALL display messages about the system working in the player's favor

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player taking multiple "Hit" actions in a single hand, I want to see varied and contextually appropriate flavor text for each subsequent hit, so that the experience feels dynamic and engaging rather than repetitive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player takes their first "Hit" action THEN the system SHALL display the base contextual flavor text for that DMV step
2. WHEN the player takes their second "Hit" action in the same hand THEN the system SHALL display alternative flavor text that builds on the first action
3. WHEN the player takes their third or subsequent "Hit" actions THEN the system SHALL display escalating flavor text that reflects increasing engagement or urgency
4. WHEN the player starts a new hand THEN the system SHALL reset the hit counter so flavor text starts fresh
5. IF no progressive flavor text is defined for a step THEN the system SHALL use fallback progressive messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player experiencing different DMV steps, I want the action button labels and descriptions to feel specific to each bureaucratic situation, so that I understand how my choices relate to real-world stress management scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player is on any DMV step THEN the action buttons SHALL display contextually appropriate labels instead of "Hit" and "Stand"
2. WHEN the player hovers over action buttons THEN the system SHALL show tooltips with DMV-specific descriptions of what the action means
3. WHEN the player completes an action THEN the system SHALL display flavor text that connects the action to stress management principles
4. IF contextual actions are not defined for a step THEN the system SHALL use generic but DMV-appropriate fallback actions
5. WHEN the game state changes THEN the system SHALL update button labels to match the current context

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player learning stress management techniques, I want the game outcomes to reinforce positive coping strategies and provide constructive feedback, so that I can apply these lessons to real-world situations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player experiences any game outcome THEN the system SHALL provide educational messaging about stress management
2. WHEN the player makes successful choices THEN the system SHALL reinforce the positive stress management behaviors demonstrated
3. WHEN the player experiences setbacks THEN the system SHALL provide encouraging messages that frame failures as learning opportunities
4. WHEN the player uses zen activities THEN the system SHALL connect these actions to real-world stress relief techniques
5. WHEN the game ends THEN the system SHALL summarize the stress management lessons learned during the DMV experience
